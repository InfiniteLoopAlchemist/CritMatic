- **Healing Tracking:** In addition to damage, CritMatic also tracks your healing output, recording the highest heal and
  critical heal for each healing spell you cast.

  additional lines to the tooltip showing your highest normal and critical hit with that spell.
- **Display Damage and Heals:** CritMatic will notify you with a message and sound effect whenever you hit a new highest
  normal or critical hit.

With **CritMatic** you'll always know when you've hit a new personal best. **Happy Criting!**

### **Planned:**

- Remove spells you don't want tracked from crit log and tooltip/chat/notification.
- Translate CritMatic to other languages soon.

### **Known Issues:**

- Some spells have the wrong icon in crit log. This is due to the spell not having a unique spell ID. I am working on a
  solution for this.
