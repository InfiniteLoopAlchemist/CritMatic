 Hot fix.





[v0.3.9-release] - 11/30/2023

 Resolved issue with /cmcritlog slash command not functioning as expected.

 You can now ignore specific spells from tracking by using /cmignore Spell Name. Make sure the spelling is correct, but it's case insensitive.

[v0.3.8.3-release] - 11/26/2023

 Fixed:

 A bug where spells not in the spellbook caused an error for the action bar tooltip.





[v0.3.8.2-release] - 11/25/2023

 Fixed:

 Good news! We've fixed a bug that affected how the crit log displayed information for spells that can both heal and damage. Previously, if a spell had both of these capabilities, the crit log wasn't displaying correctly.

 This issue did not affect spells that were exclusively for healing or damage. With this latest update, you can expect accurate and consistent display for all spells, regardless of whether they heal, damage, or do both.

 Thank you for your continued support and feedback, which helps us improve CritMatic. Enjoy your enhanced gaming experience!





[v0.3.8-release] - 11/24/2023

 Updated:

 Changed the spell data handling from using spell names to spell IDs. This update enhances localization support, allowing CritMatic to be more compatible with different language settings and paving the way for future international releases.

 Due to this change, existing spell data in CritMatic had to be cleared. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.





[v0.3.7.1-release] - 11/20/2023

 Updated:

 Crit Log now sorts by latest Crits/Hits/Crit Heals/Heals.





[v0.3.7-release] - 11/19/2023

 Added:

 New CritLog widget, that displays your latest Crits/Normal Hits/CritHeals/Heals. Open it with /cmcritlog that 
  you can macro.

 Fixed:

 Turning off social messages was not working its fixed now.





[v0.3.6.2.4-release] - 11/12/2023

 Fixed:

 Addressed the issue where critical hits (crits) were not consistently displayed correctly in the CritMatic addon, a bug fix has been implemented. This should resolve the intermittent inaccuracies in the alerts and chat crit display.

 a bug has been fixed that was preventing new critical hits (crits) from being announced in battlegrounds, raids, and parties. This update ensures that crit announcements are correctly broadcasted in these group environments.
